# Most popular coding problems (JS-version)

Here I created a collection of popular interview coding problems with different solutions, Big O notions and nice structure with levels of difficulty.
All problems solved in JavaScript, but mostly can be easily interpreted in any of popular Object-Oriented or Functional programming languages.
There is no syntax highlight in solutions, so you can explore it through 'handwritten on a piece of paper' pure solutions like in real big nerd tech gigants :)
